# testVSM_Peru
Code from magdynlab rep with modifications to test and evaluate the VSM behavior.
These modifications have been made in only two scripts: MxH_Magnet_VSM_Peru.py (from experiments folder) and field_controler_driven (from controlers folder).
Basically, some funtions have been added to get HxI and Hxt cuerver, in order to get more performance information.
